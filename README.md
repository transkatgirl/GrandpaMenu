# GrandpaMenu

A interactive, digital version of patient communication boards intended for individuals who are unable to speak.

This application should be considered a prototype rather than something ready for use.

## Setup

This application is a website meant to be loaded in [Android Kiosk](https://android-kiosk.com). However, it should be compatible with other browsers.

It can be accessed at https://transkatgirl.github.io/GrandpaMenu/. If you would like to add additional customizations, you will need to fork the repository and then host it on a webserver.
