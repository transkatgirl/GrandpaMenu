# GrandpaMenu

A interactive, digital version of patient communication boards intended for individuals who are unable to speak.

This application should be considered a prototype rather than something ready for use.

## Usage

The displayed interface can be navigated using only a pointer and left click button, making it compatible with a large variety of accessibility devices.

The end user can click on any of the available responses to highlight them, allowing for them to be read by others by looking at the screen. Some response buttons may provide follow-up questions.

In addition, the interface contains an optional text input that can be used with a keyboard. This input field can be accessed by pressing the `üó£Ô∏è To Say Something` button.

The interface state can be reset by pressing the on-screen reset button.

## Setup

This application is a website intended to be loaded in [Android Kiosk](https://android-kiosk.com). However, it is compatible with other browsers.

On other browsers, clicking anywhere on the page will automatically put the interface into fullscreen.

It can be accessed at https://transkatgirl.github.io/GrandpaMenu/. If you would like to add additional customizations, you will need to fork the repository and then host it on a webserver.
